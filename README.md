# GRC Scenarios in the Wild

This repository showcases real-world governance, risk, and compliance scenarios drawn from unconventional environments â€” livestream platforms, community organizations, and small-scale operations with high impact.

Each case includes:
- The scenario and risk identified
- Controls applied
- Remediation outcomes
- Optional AI and automation integrations

These examples reflect a boots-on-the-ground approach to GRC â€” combining instinct, integrity, and incident response under pressure.
